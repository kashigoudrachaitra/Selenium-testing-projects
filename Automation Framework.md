# Automation Framework 

## What is a Framework?
A **framework** is a **fixed structure + rules** for writing automation tests.
It helps a team write code in the same way and run tests easily.

## Why do we need a Framework?
- It defines the **company/team way of doing work**
- It gives **common coding standards**
- All team members follow the **same rules**
- Less confusion and less difference in coding style
- Faster and more accurate automation execution

## Key Points 
1. **Defines company/team way of doing things**
   - Same folder structure, same naming, same process.

2. **Common and structured standards of coding**
   - Clean and reusable code.

3. **Every member should follow same standards**
   - Easy to understand each other's code.

4. **Less differences in coding type and standard**
   - Fewer mistakes, easy maintenance.

5. **Increase speed and accuracy of automation process**
   - Reusable methods reduce time and improve results.
